## What's this project?
- It's a personal portfolio website for the 2nd semester.

## Overall experience
- This project allowed me to apply the skills and concepts learned throughout the semester, specifically leveraging Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing web design.
- Bootstrap truly simplified the design and layout process. The grid system and pre-designed components allow me to create a professional-looking website without delving into complex CSS and design details. 

## Challengs
- One of the challenges I faced was using the carousel, I hope that when the picture of the carousel slides, the content at the bottom will change accordingly, but I can't find a demo on BootStrap that I can refer to. I did a lot of searching on the web, but in the end, I couldn't find a perfect solution. Finally, I came up with a semi-automatic function by adding an in-page link to the slides of the carousel: although the content cannot change automatically with the slide of the carousel, it can be easily located by clicking the link below the slide.
- Another challenge is that I want the homepage to be able to turn the full page every time I swipe the screen or scroll the mouse, but I have tried many methods and failed to achieve it. I will try to find a better solution after the follow-up project is finished.

## Success
- Through this project, I learned a lot about Bootstrap. In the future, I will be more familiar with website development and more efficient with Bootstrap Framework's help.

## Thoughts
- All in all, this personal portfolio website project was a worthwhile attempt, and it let me know that developing a complete web page is not difficult for me. And this web page is completely customized according to my own design, I am very grateful for the knowledge I have gainedã€‚
